ImageProfiler
===============
This utility is used to collect ExIF data on a series of JPGs. The data can be collected into a CSV file or specific metrics (ISO, focal length, aperture, etc.) can be displayed as a pie chart.

I initially wrote this utility to help me analyze certain metrics regardin my photography. It helps me understand what focal lengths, apertures/lenses, etc. that I use the most.
